Writing the ISO to a DVD in Windows
==================

Windows 7, 8.X and 10 instructions
----------------

The modern versions of Windows simplify the process of writing an ISO file to a DVD by having a burner out of the box.

That being said, here's what you want to do to burn your Feren OS ISO to a DVD:

1. Insert the empty DVD Disc in your computer's DVD Drive

2. Right-click on your Feren OS ISO file in File Explorer

3. Click :guilabel:`Burn disc image`

4. Select your DVD Disc in the 'Disc burner' dropdown on the window that appears

5. Click :guilabel:`Burn` and let Windows burn your Feren OS ISO file onto that DVD Disc.


Windows 9X, ME, 2000, XP and Vista instructions
-------------------------------------

The older versions of Windows, unlike the newer ones, unfortunately do not have a disc burner by default. That being said, you can easily get a disc burner on these versions of Windows anyway.

We'd suggest using InfraRecorder and the rest of this section will cover the use of InfraRecorder to burn your Feren OS ISO to a DVD Disc. You can get InfraRecorder at `http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=5 <http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=5>`_.

Once you have InfraRecorder set up and running, here's what you need to do to burn your Feren OS ISO to a DVD Disc:

1. Insert the empty DVD Disc in your computer's DVD Drive

2. In InfraRecorder go to :guilabel:`Actions` -> :guilabel:`Burn Image...`

3. Select your downloaded Feren OS ISO file in the dialog that appears

4. Click 'OK' in the next dialog that appears.

5. Let InfraRecorder burn your Feren OS ISO file onto that DVD Disc.

Writing the ISO to a DVD in macOS
==================

macOS instructions
----------------

Burning your Feren OS ISO file to a DVD using macOS is very easy as the utilities needed are already integrated into macOS. Here's what you want to do to burn your Feren OS ISO to a DVD Disc:

1. Insert the empty DVD Disc in your computer's DVD Drive

2. Right-click on your Feren OS ISO file in Finder

3. Click :guilabel:`Burn Disk Image "(the ISO file name goes here).iso" to Disc...`

4. Select your DVD in the 'Burn Disc In:' dropdown if it is not already selected on the dialog that appears

5. Click :guilabel:`Burn` on that dialog and let macOS burn your Feren OS ISO file onto that DVD Disc.

.. warning::
    If you have a macOS version older than 10.5 you won't have this option. You should use Disk Utility or Disk Copy instead to burn your Feren OS ISO file to a DVD on older macOS versions than macOS 10.5.

Theme Colouriser
==================

What is the theme colouriser?
----------------

The Theme Colouriser utility is a utility for Feren OS that is designed to let you quickly create themes off of compatible themes. These created themes are the same as the originals except their accent colours are changed to be what you have specified. Basically think of this utility as an accent colour changer.


Using Theme Colouriser in Feren OS
----------------

Using Theme Colouriser is very easy. To create a theme colourisation, do the following:

1. Open up Theme Colouriser (Applications Menu --> Settings --> Theme Colouriser)

2. Select :guilabel:`Create a new theme colourisation` and click :guilabel:`OK`

3. Pick the theme you want to create an accent colourisation of (:guilabel:`Feren OS Theme` is the default theme)

4. Pick a colour and click :guilabel:`Select`

5. Name your theme and click :guilabel:`OK`

6. Select what theme type you'd like to use ('Default' is the dark panel but light applications, 'Light' is light everything and 'Dark' is dark everything) and click :guilabel:`OK`

7. Choose whether you would like the titlebars and window borders to be coloured by your accent colour (if you choose :guilabel:`No` the titlebars will be silver or dark grey depending on the theme type)

8. Click :guilabel:`OK` on the theme creation confirmation dialog and then choose whether to apply the theme now or not


To apply an existing theme colourisation later, all in one go, do the following:

1. Open up Theme Colouriser (Applications Menu --> Settings --> Theme Colouriser)

2. Select :guilabel:`Apply an existing theme colourisation` and click :guilabel:`OK`

3. Select the theme colourisation you would like to apply and click :guilabel:`OK`

.. hint::
    You can apply created theme colourisations in System Settings, however that entails applying the Plasma Theme, Colour Scheme and GTK Theme manually (as well as the general Feren OS Global Theme beforehand if you have changed the overall theme)


To delete an existing theme colourisation, do the following:

1. Open up Theme Colouriser (Applications Menu --> Settings --> Theme Colouriser)

2. Select :guilabel:`Remove an existing theme colourisation` and click :guilabel:`OK`

3. Select the theme colourisation you would like to delete and click :guilabel:`OK`


Using Theme Colouriser in Feren OS Classic
----------------

Using Theme Colouriser is very easy. Unlike the version Feren OS comes with however, Theme Colouriser in Feren OS Classic can only make theme colourisations for compatible themes.

To create a theme colourisation, do the following:

1. Open up Theme Colouriser (Applications Menu --> Preferences --> Theme Colouriser)

2. Pick the theme you want to create an accent colourisation of (:guilabel:`feren` is the default theme)

3. Pick a colour and click :guilabel:`Select`

4. Name your theme and click :guilabel:`OK`

5. Choose whether you would like the titlebars and window borders to be coloured by your accent colour (if you choose :guilabel:`No` the titlebars will be silver and you'll be asked if you want to colour just the titlebar button symbols instead)

6. Click :guilabel:`OK` on the theme creation confirmation dialog and then choose whether to apply the theme now or not

Theme Colourisations can be applied later manually through System Settings --> Themes.

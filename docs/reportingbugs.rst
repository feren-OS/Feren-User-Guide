Reporting Bugs
==================

Where and how do I report bugs?
----------------

Because of the nature of Feren OS, there are three main locations to report bugs at:

Feren OS Bug Reporting: https://github.com/feren-OS/Bug-Reporting-Center/issues/ :menuselection:`--> New`

Linux Mint Bug Reporting: https://github.com/linuxmint :menuselection:`--> project name of project you're writing a bug report for --> Issues --> New`

Ubuntu Bug Reporting: Open up Terminal/Konsole (:menuselection:`Applications Menu --> System / Administration --> Konsole / Terminal`), type ``ubuntu-bug (package you are reporting a bug for goes here without brackets)`` and press :kbd:`Enter` to report a bug


If you are not sure about where to report a bug, don't be afraid to `ask around <https://feren-os-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wheretofindhelp.html>` as well as others will very likely know, from the application you describe, just what you want to report a bug for and where you can report it at.

Reporting Bugs
==================

Where and how do I report bugs?
----------------

Because of the nature of Feren OS, there are three main locations to report bugs at:

Feren OS Bug Reporting: https://github.com/feren-OS/Bug-Reporting-Center/issues/ --> New

Linux Mint Bug Reporting: https://github.com/linuxmint --> project name of project you're writing a bug report for --> Issues --> New

Ubuntu Bug Reporting: Open up Terminal/Konsole (Applications Menu --> System / Administration --> Konsole / Terminal), type ``ubuntu-bug (package you are reporting a bug for here without brackets)`` and press :kbd:`Enter` to report a bug


If you are not sure about where to report a bug, don't be afraid to ask around on https://ferenos.weebly.com/help and on other places as well as others will know from the application just what you want to report a bug for and where you can report it at.

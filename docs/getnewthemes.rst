Getting new themes
==================

.. hint::
    This guide doesn't work on Feren OS Classic. For Feren OS Classic you need to download and install themes from an external source.


To get a new themes, go into the area in :menuselection:`System Settings --> Theme` that you want to obtain themes/icon sets/etc for and click the :guilabel:`Get New (item here)...` button at the bottom-right above :guilabel:`Apply`. A window will now pop up allowing you to install and remove a variety of themes/icon sets/etc (depending on the settings area you are getting more items for) made by the community.

To install them, simply find the theme/icon set/etc you want, click :guilabel:`Install` for them, let it install and then when you're done close the window and the settings area you just got themes/icon sets/etc for should now populate with the ones that were successfully installed.

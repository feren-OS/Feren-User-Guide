To change login screen related settings, you will want to open up Login Window.

The following is a list of what each setting does:

* Delay before connection: Time before the user is automatically logged in when booting into Feren OS

Settings:

Panel indicators:

* Hostname: Toggle the text at the top-left of the login screen
* Accessibility options: Toggle the accessibility options icon and menu visibility
